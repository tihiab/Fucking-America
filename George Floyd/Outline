George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota 
after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck 
for almost nine minutes 
while Floyd was handcuffed face down in the street.
Two other officers further restrained Floyd and a fourth officer prevented onlookers from intervening.
During the final three minutes Floyd was motionless and had no pulse.
Officers made no attempt to revive him,
and Chauvin's knee remained on Floyd's neck 
as arriving emergency medical technicians attempted to treat him.
